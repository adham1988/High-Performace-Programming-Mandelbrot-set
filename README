In this folder you can find Mandelbrot implementation in three different versions in main.ipynb.

version 1 naive version
version 2 vectorized numpy
version 3 multiprocessing 

Every version's output is a figure that illustrates the Mandelbrot set generated by every version. 
These figures is saved in this folder. 

The matrices generated by every version are stored respectively in the following HDF files:
(naiveVersion.hdf5, VectorizedVersion.hdf5, multyVersion.hdf5)

In addition, a short description about the code design, the code optimization and the conducted test, can found in the document softwardesign.pdf
